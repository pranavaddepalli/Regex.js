## Regex.js

Regex.js is a simple regular expression engine built in JavaScript, based on the traditional backtracking algorithm. 

I wrote this to better understand the backtracking algorithm as well as to gain some experience with regular expressions, but it is especially useful for web developers intending to implement a client-side search. The majority of the backtracking algorithm's implementation is based on [this](https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/regular-expressions/184410904) C implementation, but I have added handling for the * and + special characters.
